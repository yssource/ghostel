;;; Commentary:

;; Run `compile'-style shell commands inside a ghostel terminal
;; buffer.  Unlike \\[compile] (which runs commands through comint),
;; `ghostel-compile' runs them in a real TTY via ghostel so programs
;; that detect a terminal (progress bars, colours, curses tools)
;; behave as they would in an interactive shell.
;;
;; Each `ghostel-compile' invocation spawns a fresh process via
;; `shell-file-name -c COMMAND' through a PTY owned by the ghostel
;; renderer — no interactive shell sits between the command and the
;; user.  Multi-line scripts are passed verbatim to the shell.  No
;; OSC 133 / shell integration is required; completion is detected
;; by the process sentinel, which delivers the real exit status.
;;
;; The buffer mimics `compilation-mode': a "Compilation started at"
;; header, a "Compilation finished at ..., duration ..." footer, and
;; the same `mode-line-process' run/exit faces.
;;
;; By default the buffer is read-only and behaves like a
;; `compilation-mode' buffer from the start: `g' reruns, `n'/`p'
;; walk errors, RET jumps to the source.  Pass a prefix arg
;; (\\[universal-argument] \\[ghostel-compile]) to launch the buffer
;; in interactive mode instead - keystrokes reach the running
;; process so programs like `htop', `less', or test prompts work.
;;
;; When the command finishes, the renderer is torn down and the
;; buffer's major mode is switched to `ghostel-compile-view-mode'
;; (derived from `compilation-mode').  At that point the buffer is a
;; regular, read-only Emacs buffer with standard error highlighting
;; and `next-error' navigation.  It will not return to an interactive
;; ghostel terminal — a recompile (`g', `M-x ghostel-recompile')
;; discards it and starts fresh in the original `default-directory'.
;; When invoked from inside the compile buffer, recompile preserves
;; the launch mode (read-only vs interactive); when invoked from an
;; unrelated buffer it falls back to the global default (read-only).
;;
;; Enable `ghostel-compile-global-mode' to route *all* `compile',
;; `recompile', `project-compile', ... calls through ghostel.  It
;; advises `compilation-start' so every caller benefits without any
;; further configuration.  `compilation-start' callers asking for
;; `MODE=t' (the comint variant — \\[universal-argument] \\[compile])
;; are routed to a writable ghostel terminal instead of comint.
;; `grep-mode' falls through to the stock implementation.
;;
;; Standard `compile' options honoured:
;;   `compile-command' / `compile-history' (shared with \\[compile])
;;   `compilation-read-command'
;;   `compilation-ask-about-save'
;;   `compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error'
;;   `compilation-finish-functions' (runs alongside
;;     `ghostel-compile-finish-functions')
;;   `compilation-scroll-output' (effectively always on)
;;
;; Keys in the finished buffer:
;;   g           — ghostel-recompile
;;   n / p       — compilation-next-error / -previous-error (no auto-open)
;;   RET         — compile-goto-error (open the source)
;;   M-g n / M-g p — standard `next-error' / `previous-error'

its window, matching `M-x recompile').

If the existing buffer has a live process, prompt via `yes-or-no-p'

Otherwise routes COMMAND through `ghostel-compile--start':

- MODE is nil or `compilation-mode' - read-only ghostel buffer
- MODE is t - `compilation-start's request for an interactive
  comint buffer.  We honour the *interactive* part by spawning a

When enabled, advises `compilation-start' so that \\[compile],

goes through `compilation-start' runs in a ghostel terminal —
giving you a real TTY for progress bars, colours, and curses tools
without having to switch commands.

The default routing is read-only: a plain \\[compile] (or any caller
passing `MODE=nil' / `MODE=compilation-mode') yields a read-only buffer
that behaves like a `compilation-mode' buffer.  Callers asking for the
comint variant \(\\[universal-argument] \\[compile], i.e. `MODE=t') are
routed to a writable ghostel terminal - interactive throughout the run,
so programs like `htop' or test prompts work - instead of falling
through to `comint-mode'.  Note: this means `compilation-shell-minor-mode'
is *not* enabled in the interactive variant - its keymap would shadow
`ghostel-mode's input handlers and break key forwarding to the PTY.
Custom `compilation-mode' subclasses yield a read-only buffer that
finalizes into the subclass.

Modes in `ghostel-compile-global-mode-excluded-modes' (by default,
`grep-mode') still use the stock implementation, since their output
parsers and window-management conventions don't fit a live TTY."
