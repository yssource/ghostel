;;; Commentary:

;; Ghostel is an Emacs terminal emulator powered by libghostty-vt, the
;; terminal emulation library extracted from the Ghostty project.  A
;; native Zig dynamic module handles VT parsing, terminal state, and
;; rendering, while this Elisp layer manages the shell process, keymap,
;; buffer, and user-facing commands.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   M-x ghostel          Open a new terminal
;;   M-x ghostel-project  Open a terminal in the current project root
;;   M-x ghostel-other    Switch to next terminal or create one
;;
;; Key bindings in the terminal buffer:
;;
;;   Most keys are sent directly to the shell.  Keys in
;;   `ghostel-keymap-exceptions' (C-c, C-x, M-x, etc.) pass through
;;   to Emacs.  Terminal control and navigation use a C-c prefix:
;;
;;   C-c C-c   Interrupt          C-c C-z   Suspend
;;   C-c C-d   EOF                C-c C-\   Quit
;;   C-c C-t   Copy mode          C-c C-y   Paste
;;   C-c C-l   Clear scrollback   C-c C-q   Send next key literally
;;   C-c M-w   Copy scrollback    C-y / M-y Yank / yank-pop
;;   C-c C-n / C-c C-p            Next/previous hyperlink
;;   C-c M-n / C-c M-p            Next/previous prompt (OSC 133)
;;
;; Copy mode (C-c C-t) freezes the display and enables standard Emacs
;; navigation.  Set mark with C-SPC, select text, then M-w to copy.
;;
;; Shell integration:
;;
;;   Directory tracking (OSC 7), prompt navigation (OSC 133), and the
;;   `ghostel_cmd' helper are auto-injected for bash, zsh, and fish —
;;   no shell rc changes needed.  Controlled by `ghostel-shell-integration'
;;   (default t); set it to nil to source etc/shell/ghostel.{bash,zsh,fish}
;;   manually instead.
;;
;; Native module:
;;
;;   A pre-built binary is downloaded automatically on first use.  To
;;   build from source instead (requires Zig 0.15.2+), run zig build
;;   from the project root, or M-x ghostel-module-compile.  M-x
;;   ghostel-download-module re-fetches the pre-built binary.
;;
;; See also: evil-ghostel.el (evil-mode integration), ghostel-compile.el
;; (TTY-backed M-x compile replacement), ghostel-eshell.el (eshell
;; visual-command integration).  TRAMP paths as `default-directory'
;; spawn remote shells; see README.md for details.

  "Value of the TERM environment variable for ghostel processes.

The default \"xterm-ghostty\" advertises ghostel's capability set via
the bundled terminfo entry: synchronized output (DEC 2026), Kitty
keyboard protocol, true color, colored underlines, focus reporting,
and more.  Apps that key off these capabilities — Claude Code, modern
TUIs, neovim, tmux — will use their fast paths.  Notably,
synchronized output eliminates choppy partial-redraw effects when
Claude Code or similar TUIs repaint over a large scrollback.

OSC 52 clipboard is supported (`ghostel-enable-osc52', off by
default) but intentionally NOT advertised in the bundled terminfo,
to avoid silent yank drops when the option is disabled.

Set to \"xterm-256color\" to fall back to a generic terminal.  When
`ghostel-term' is not \"xterm-ghostty\", the bundled terminfo and
`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty' are not advertised, so nothing claims to be
Ghostty.  This is also the right setting if outbound `ssh' from a
ghostel buffer trips up on remote hosts that lack the xterm-ghostty
terminfo entry."

(defcustom ghostel-environment nil
  "Extra environment variables for ghostel shell processes.

A list of \"KEY=VALUE\" strings, prepended to `process-environment'
before spawning the shell.  A bare \"KEY\" (no `=') unsets the variable.

For local spawns, entries here take precedence over ghostel's own
variables (TERM, INSIDE_EMACS, EMACS_GHOSTEL_PATH,
shell-integration vars), so a user who sets TERM here wins — which
will also disable ghostel's shell integration if the chosen TERM
breaks its assumptions.

Also honored via `dir-locals.el' for per-project overrides.

TRAMP caveats:
- Entries with `=' are propagated to the remote shell.
- TERM/TERMINFO/TERM_PROGRAM/TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION/COLORTERM here
  are ignored for remote spawns and overridden unconditionally by
  the per-spawn `/bin/sh -c' wrapper after `infocmp'-probing the
  remote for `xterm-ghostty' terminfo.  TRAMP's
  `tramp-local-environment-variable-p' filter strips env entries
  that match the local default top-level `process-environment',
  so pushing TERM via env was unreliable; the wrapper exports
  these from inside the remote shell instead, where the filter
  doesn't reach.  Customize `ghostel-term' (locally, or per-host
  via dir-locals or `connection-local-set-profile-variables') to
  change what gets advertised; on a customized branch the wrapper
  exports `TERM=$ghostel-term' only — no `TERM_PROGRAM*' ghostty
  advertisement.  Every other entry in this list still propagates.
- INSIDE_EMACS is rewritten by TRAMP via `tramp-inside-emacs',
  which appends `,tramp:VER' to whatever value is in scope.  For
  ghostel that means the remote shell sees `ghostel,tramp:VER'
  rather than the bare `ghostel' set locally — the leading
  `ghostel' segment is preserved.
- Bare \"KEY\" unset works for TRAMP-sh methods (`ssh', `sudo', ...)
  which emit `unset KEY' in the remote wrapper, but is dropped by
  the generic handler used by `adb' and `sshfs'.

Example: \\='(\"LANG=en_US.UTF-8\" \"CC=clang\")"

The full scrollback is materialized into the Emacs buffer so that
`isearch', `consult-line', and other buffer-based commands work
across history.  Each materialized row also lives in the Emacs
buffer with text properties for color/style/links, so the
practical Emacs heap cost is roughly equal to the libghostty

Used when answering XTWINOPS queries (CSI 14/16 t) and when telling
libghostty's kitty graphics protocol the cell dimensions.  Image
tools — timg, yazi, tmux passthrough — query the terminal for cell
pixel size to compute placement dimensions; if the value reported is
smaller than what the standalone Ghostty terminal would report, they
either fall back to half-block rendering (timg) or fill more cells
than expected with upscaled, blocky output (yazi).

`auto' computes the display DPI from `display-mm-width' and
`display-pixel-width' and uses DPI/96 directly as a float.  Standard
~96 DPI displays resolve to ~1.0; HiDPI displays (~150 DPI) resolve
to ~1.5; ~192 DPI displays to ~2.0.  If the display's physical size
isn't reported (some multi-monitor setups, virtual displays), falls
back to 1.

This is a heuristic — Emacs has no portable API for the OS-level
backing scale factor, so exact parity with standalone Ghostty
\(which measures cell size in real physical pixels via the window
server) requires setting an explicit number here.  Useful overrides:
the exact `physical_cell_w / frame-char-width' ratio (e.g. 2.28) for
pixel-perfect parity with standalone Ghostty's image rendering, or
1 to opt out of HiDPI-aware reporting altogether.

Note that `image-scaling-factor' is *not* a useful signal here:
Emacs's `auto' resolves it from `frame-char-width' (a font-width
heuristic for image-vs-text scaling), not from the display's DPI
or backing scale factor."

passthrough, etc.) instruct ghostel to read arbitrary paths or shared
memory regions on the local machine — a privilege-escalation surface.

The matched path is resolved against `default-directory'; linkification
only applies when that file exists.  The default matches absolute

output like `src/main.rs').  Paths embedded in punctuation like

Performance: each match triggers a filesystem check on every redraw.
Broadening this pattern (for example to match bare `file.go' without

positions or line numbers) so lookups survive the native redraw's
buffer reshuffles (eraseBuffer + re-insert, scrollback eviction,
viewport rewrite) while libghostty's logical content is preserved.

The alist is rebuilt each redraw.  The pre-redraw pass in
`ghostel--delayed-redraw' uses a heuristic to distinguish Emacs
clamping `window-start' to `point-min' (restore from saved key) from a
legitimate user scroll to a different valid position (refresh saved
key to match).  The heuristic misfires if Emacs moves `window-start'
to a non-`point-min' non-saved position (e.g. programmatic
`recenter', `follow-mode', window split layouts); in that case the
saved key is refreshed to the new content and the original scroll
intent is lost.  That's an accepted tradeoff for avoiding a

Called from the native module during redraw for each visible placement.
DATA is a unibyte string (PNG or PPM).
IS-PNG is non-nil for PNG, nil for PPM.
ABS-ROW is the absolute buffer row (0-indexed from `point-min'),
already accounting for materialized scrollback (the C side adds
`scrollback_in_buffer' to libghostty's viewport-relative row before
passing it here).  Without that pre-shift, an image at viewport row 0
would render at the top of the scrollback, jumping into the past as
soon as anything scrolled.  May be negative when the image's top is
above the buffer's first line (rare — only when libghostty's scrollback
got trimmed below the placement's anchor).
VP-COL is the column (may be negative — image partially off the left).
GRID-COLS and GRID-ROWS are the cell dimensions.
PIXEL-W and PIXEL-H are the rendered pixel dimensions.
SRC-X / SRC-Y / SRC-W / SRC-H are the source-rect crop in image pixels;
all zero means the whole image (the common case from timg/yazi).

The image is sized to fill its grid cells and then sliced per row, with
each slice applied on its own buffer line.  Slicing — rather than a
single multi-line `display' property — is required for the image to
actually occupy each cell row (otherwise Emacs draws the image once at
the first character of the range and the remaining rows show the
underlying text or stay blank).  Mirrors the virtual-placeholder path's
`:ascent \\='center' and `line-height' clamping so slices tile flush
across rows.

Falls back to PIXEL-W/PIXEL-H when GRID-COLS/GRID-ROWS arrive as 0 —
libghostty hasn't computed the cell layout yet on the first redraw
after a placement (a subsequent layout change would fix it, but the
user shouldn't have to trigger one)."

   zero-width kitty overlays per start-position — more than one at the

2. Orphan text-property slices.  When eviction straddles an image, the

- `-ixon': disable XON/XOFF flow control so the XON/XOFF characters

  "Return a `/bin/sh' snippet that sets TERM for a remote spawn wrapper.
Designed to run *on the remote*, inside the per-spawn `/bin/sh -c'
wrapper, so the choice happens after TRAMP env propagation.  This
sidesteps `tramp-local-environment-variable-p', which strips
`TERM=' entries that match the local default top-level
`process-environment' — leaving the remote shell to inherit
TERM=dumb from TRAMP's connection shell, and disabling
readline/ZLE/fish line editing on the remote (issue #224).

When `ghostel-term' is the default \"xterm-ghostty\", the snippet:
1. Prepends ~/.local/share/ghostel/terminfo to TERMINFO_DIRS when
   that directory holds the bundled entry.  This lets manual
   setups co-locate terminfo with the shell-integration scripts
   (see README, \"Option 2: Manual setup\") in one place — no
   `tic', no touching ~/.terminfo.
2. Probes via `infocmp xterm-ghostty'.  The probe honors all of
   ncurses' standard lookup paths (the prepended dir, $TERMINFO,
   ~/.terminfo, $TERMINFO_DIRS, and the compiled defaults), so
   it succeeds whenever the entry is reachable any way — bundled,
   system-installed, or pushed via `ghostel-tramp-shell-integration'.
   On success, advertise ghostty; on failure, fall back to
   \"xterm-256color\" (universally available) so echo keeps working.

When `ghostel-term' was customized to anything else, honor it
verbatim.  `COLORTERM=truecolor' is exported unconditionally."

  "Initialize BUFFER as a ghostel terminal if no terminal handle exists yet.
Terminal dimensions come from BUFFER's displayed window when one
exists, otherwise from the selected window.  Height uses
`window-screen-lines' (the metric the standard
`adjust-window-size-function' path also uses), not
`window-body-height'.  The former divides the window's pixel height
by the buffer's `default-line-height', which respects
`face-remapping-alist' and `:height' on the default face; the latter
divides by frame char height.  When a theme remaps default —
`nano-light' / `nano-dark' do this — the two metrics disagree, and
using `window-body-height' would size the terminal to N rows only to
have the standard adjust-fn immediately resize to N-K, sending a
startup SIGWINCH that some TUI apps (Claude Code's /tui fullscreen)
handle imperfectly (issue #192).
IDENTITY, if given, is stored as `ghostel--buffer-identity' so the
buffer can be found again after title-tracking renames it."
