;;; Commentary:

;; Ghostel is an Emacs terminal emulator powered by libghostty-vt, the
;; terminal emulation library extracted from the Ghostty project.  A
;; native Zig dynamic module handles VT parsing, terminal state, and
;; rendering, while this Elisp layer manages the shell process, keymap,
;; buffer, and user-facing commands.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   M-x ghostel          Open a new terminal
;;   M-x ghostel-project  Open a terminal in the current project root
;;   M-x ghostel-other    Switch to next terminal or create one
;;
;; Key bindings in the terminal buffer:
;;
;;   Most keys are sent directly to the shell.  Keys in
;;   `ghostel-keymap-exceptions' (C-c, C-x, M-x, etc.) pass through
;;   to Emacs.  Terminal control and navigation use a C-c prefix:
;;
;;   C-c C-c   Interrupt          C-c C-z   Suspend
;;   C-c C-d   EOF                C-c C-\   Quit
;;   C-c C-t   Copy mode          C-c C-y   Paste
;;   C-c C-l   Clear scrollback   C-c C-q   Send next key literally
;;   C-c M-w   Copy scrollback    C-y / M-y Yank / yank-pop
;;   C-c C-n / C-c C-p            Next/previous hyperlink
;;   C-c M-n / C-c M-p            Next/previous prompt (OSC 133)
;;
;; Copy mode (C-c C-t) freezes the display and enables standard Emacs
;; navigation.  Set mark with C-SPC, select text, then M-w to copy.
;;
;; Shell integration:
;;
;;   Directory tracking (OSC 7), prompt navigation (OSC 133), and the
;;   `ghostel_cmd' helper are auto-injected for bash, zsh, and fish —
;;   no shell rc changes needed.  Controlled by `ghostel-shell-integration'
;;   (default t); set it to nil to source etc/shell/ghostel.{bash,zsh,fish}
;;   manually instead.
;;
;; Native module:
;;
;;   A pre-built binary is downloaded automatically on first use.  To
;;   build from source instead (requires Zig 0.15.2+), run zig build
;;   from the project root, or M-x ghostel-module-compile.  M-x
;;   ghostel-download-module re-fetches the pre-built binary.
;;
;; See also: evil-ghostel.el (evil-mode integration), ghostel-compile.el
;; (TTY-backed M-x compile replacement), ghostel-eshell.el (eshell
;; visual-command integration).  TRAMP paths as `default-directory'
;; spawn remote shells; see README.md for details.

The default \"xterm-ghostty\" advertises ghostel's capability set via
the bundled terminfo entry: synchronized output (DEC 2026), Kitty
keyboard protocol, true color, colored underlines, focus reporting,
and more.  Apps that key off these capabilities — Claude Code, modern
TUIs, neovim, tmux — will use their fast paths.  Notably,
synchronized output eliminates choppy partial-redraw effects when
Claude Code or similar TUIs repaint over a large scrollback.

OSC 52 clipboard is supported (`ghostel-enable-osc52', off by
default) but intentionally NOT advertised in the bundled terminfo,
to avoid silent yank drops when the option is disabled.

Set to \"xterm-256color\" to fall back to a generic terminal.  When
`ghostel-term' is not \"xterm-ghostty\", the bundled terminfo and
`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty' are not advertised, so nothing claims to be
Ghostty.  This is also the right setting if outbound `ssh' from a
ghostel buffer trips up on remote hosts that lack the xterm-ghostty
terminfo entry."

(defcustom ghostel-environment nil
  "Extra environment variables for ghostel shell processes.

A list of \"KEY=VALUE\" strings, prepended to `process-environment'
before spawning the shell.  A bare \"KEY\" (no `=') unsets the variable.

For local spawns, entries here take precedence over ghostel's own
variables (TERM, INSIDE_EMACS, EMACS_GHOSTEL_PATH,
shell-integration vars), so a user who sets TERM here wins — which
will also disable ghostel's shell integration if the chosen TERM
breaks its assumptions.

Also honored via `dir-locals.el' for per-project overrides.

TRAMP caveats:
- Entries with `=' are propagated to the remote shell.
- TERM/TERMINFO/TERM_PROGRAM/TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION/COLORTERM here
  are ignored for remote spawns and overridden unconditionally by
  the per-spawn `/bin/sh -c' wrapper after `infocmp'-probing the
  remote for `xterm-ghostty' terminfo.  TRAMP's
  `tramp-local-environment-variable-p' filter strips env entries
  that match the local default top-level `process-environment',
  so pushing TERM via env was unreliable; the wrapper exports
  these from inside the remote shell instead, where the filter
  doesn't reach.  Customize `ghostel-term' (locally, or per-host
  via dir-locals or `connection-local-set-profile-variables') to
  change what gets advertised; on a customized branch the wrapper
  exports `TERM=$ghostel-term' only — no `TERM_PROGRAM*' ghostty
  advertisement.  Every other entry in this list still propagates.
- INSIDE_EMACS is rewritten by TRAMP via `tramp-inside-emacs',
  which appends `,tramp:VER' to whatever value is in scope.  For
  ghostel that means the remote shell sees `ghostel,tramp:VER'
  rather than the bare `ghostel' set locally — the leading
  `ghostel' segment is preserved.
- Bare \"KEY\" unset works for TRAMP-sh methods (`ssh', `sudo', ...)
  which emit `unset KEY' in the remote wrapper, but is dropped by
  the generic handler used by `adb' and `sshfs'.

Example: \\='(\"LANG=en_US.UTF-8\" \"CC=clang\")"

across history.  Each materialized row also lives in the Emacs

practical Emacs heap cost is roughly equal to the libghostty

Used when answering XTWINOPS queries (CSI 14/16 t) and when telling
libghostty's kitty graphics protocol the cell dimensions.  Image
tools — timg, yazi, tmux passthrough — query the terminal for cell
pixel size to compute placement dimensions; if the value reported is
smaller than what the standalone Ghostty terminal would report, they
either fall back to half-block rendering (timg) or fill more cells
than expected with upscaled, blocky output (yazi).

`auto' computes the display DPI from `display-mm-width' and
`display-pixel-width' and uses DPI/96 directly as a float.  Standard
~96 DPI displays resolve to ~1.0; HiDPI displays (~150 DPI) resolve
to ~1.5; ~192 DPI displays to ~2.0.  If the display's physical size
isn't reported (some multi-monitor setups, virtual displays), falls
back to 1.

This is a heuristic — Emacs has no portable API for the OS-level
backing scale factor, so exact parity with standalone Ghostty
\(which measures cell size in real physical pixels via the window
server) requires setting an explicit number here.  Useful overrides:
the exact `physical_cell_w / frame-char-width' ratio (e.g. 2.28) for
pixel-perfect parity with standalone Ghostty's image rendering, or
1 to opt out of HiDPI-aware reporting altogether.

Note that `image-scaling-factor' is *not* a useful signal here:
Emacs's `auto' resolves it from `frame-char-width' (a font-width
heuristic for image-vs-text scaling), not from the display's DPI

with a fixed leading path-boundary anchor (line start or any

The matched path is resolved against `default-directory'; linkification
only applies when that file exists.  The default matches absolute
paths, explicit `./' paths, tilde-prefixed paths like `~/file.el',
and bare relative paths containing at least one `/' (e.g. compiler
output like `src/main.rs').  Paths embedded in punctuation like
`(/home/user/index.js:17:5)' are supported via the fixed anchor.

Performance: each match triggers a filesystem check on every redraw.
Broadening this pattern (for example to match bare `file.go' without
a `/') will cause `file-exists-p' to be called for every matching
token, which can be expensive on slow or network filesystems (NFS,

`ghostel--delayed-redraw' uses a heuristic to distinguish Emacs
clamping `window-start' to `point-min' (restore from saved key) from a

key to match).  The heuristic misfires if Emacs moves `window-start'
to a non-`point-min' non-saved position (e.g. programmatic
`recenter', `follow-mode', window split layouts); in that case the

transpose, etc.) works.  Pressing \\[ghostel-line-mode-send]
sends the entire line to the shell in one write; bash echoes and
executes it normally.

The terminal stays live: output streaming in around the prompt
keeps rendering, and the snapshot/restore path in
`ghostel--delayed-redraw' preserves the user's in-progress input
across each redraw cycle.  After RET, line mode stays active so
the user just keeps editing at the next prompt.

env vars, executables on \\=`PATH\\=', and whatever \\=`pcomplete\\='
extensions are loaded.  Install the `bash-completion' package and
set `ghostel-line-mode-use-bash-completion' to layer real bash
programmable completion (git subcommands, ssh hosts, …) on top.

Uses the terminal cursor as the input-area boundary, so REPLs
without OSC 133 (python3, irb, sqlite3, …) work too.  When OSC
133 markers are present on the cursor's row, the prompt prefix is
recognised and the input boundary lands right after it.

While a fullscreen TUI is on the alt screen, line mode cannot
edit (the TUI needs every keystroke raw); calling this command
during an alt-screen session arms a deferred-activation sentinel
instead, and line mode resumes automatically when the TUI exits."

  "Display a kitty graphics image placement in the buffer.
Called from the native module during redraw for each visible placement.
DATA is a unibyte string (PNG or PPM).
IS-PNG is non-nil for PNG, nil for PPM.
ABS-ROW is the absolute buffer row (0-indexed from `point-min'),
already accounting for materialized scrollback (the C side adds
`scrollback_in_buffer' to libghostty's viewport-relative row before
passing it here).  Without that pre-shift, an image at viewport row 0
would render at the top of the scrollback, jumping into the past as
soon as anything scrolled.  May be negative when the image's top is
above the buffer's first line (rare — only when libghostty's scrollback
got trimmed below the placement's anchor).
VP-COL is the column (may be negative — image partially off the left).
GRID-COLS and GRID-ROWS are the cell dimensions.
PIXEL-W and PIXEL-H are the rendered pixel dimensions.
SRC-X / SRC-Y / SRC-W / SRC-H are the source-rect crop in image pixels;
all zero means the whole image (the common case from timg/yazi).

The image is sized to fill its grid cells and then sliced per row, with
each slice applied on its own buffer line.  Slicing — rather than a
single multi-line `display' property — is required for the image to
actually occupy each cell row (otherwise Emacs draws the image once at
the first character of the range and the remaining rows show the
underlying text or stay blank).  Mirrors the virtual-placeholder path's
`:ascent \\='center' and `line-height' clamping so slices tile flush
across rows.

Falls back to PIXEL-W/PIXEL-H when GRID-COLS/GRID-ROWS arrive as 0 —
libghostty hasn't computed the cell layout yet on the first redraw
after a placement (a subsequent layout change would fix it, but the
user shouldn't have to trigger one)."

- `-ixon': disable XON/XOFF flow control so the XON/XOFF characters

  "Return a `/bin/sh' snippet that sets TERM for a remote spawn wrapper.
Designed to run *on the remote*, inside the per-spawn `/bin/sh -c'
wrapper, so the choice happens after TRAMP env propagation.  This
sidesteps `tramp-local-environment-variable-p', which strips
`TERM=' entries that match the local default top-level
`process-environment' — leaving the remote shell to inherit
TERM=dumb from TRAMP's connection shell, and disabling
readline/ZLE/fish line editing on the remote (issue #224).

When `ghostel-term' is the default \"xterm-ghostty\", the snippet:
1. Prepends ~/.local/share/ghostel/terminfo to TERMINFO_DIRS when
   that directory holds the bundled entry.  This lets manual
   setups co-locate terminfo with the shell-integration scripts
   (see README, \"Option 2: Manual setup\") in one place — no
   `tic', no touching ~/.terminfo.
2. Probes via `infocmp xterm-ghostty'.  The probe honors all of
   ncurses' standard lookup paths (the prepended dir, $TERMINFO,
   ~/.terminfo, $TERMINFO_DIRS, and the compiled defaults), so
   it succeeds whenever the entry is reachable any way — bundled,
   system-installed, or pushed via `ghostel-tramp-shell-integration'.
   On success, advertise ghostty; on failure, fall back to
   \"xterm-256color\" (universally available) so echo keeps working.

When `ghostel-term' was customized to anything else, honor it
verbatim.  `COLORTERM=truecolor' is exported unconditionally."

a window absent from `ghostel--scroll-positions' whose `window-point'

redraw left it following the viewport, and a drifted `window-start'
below the anchor is Emacs redisplay (e.g. `keep-point-visible' when
the minibuffer shrinks the window), not a user scroll.  The
`window-point' guard on the resize branch matters because consult-line
and friends open and close a minibuffer that resizes the body twice;
without it, the second resize would re-anchor a window whose point
the user had moved into scrollback during the preview.

The `window-point' check fixes the case where navigation moves
point into scrollback without moving `window-start' — `consult-line',
`consult-imenu', `goto-char' from a command, etc.  Without it,
those jumps would be misclassified as \"following the cursor\" and

falls behind the anchor and is misclassified as scrollback (issue

`window-body-height'.  The former divides the window's pixel height
by the buffer's `default-line-height', which respects
`face-remapping-alist' and `:height' on the default face; the latter
divides by frame char height.  When a theme remaps default —
`nano-light' / `nano-dark' do this — the two metrics disagree, and
using `window-body-height' would size the terminal to N rows only to
have the standard adjust-fn immediately resize to N-K, sending a
startup SIGWINCH that some TUI apps (Claude Code's /tui fullscreen)
handle imperfectly (issue #192).
