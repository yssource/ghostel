A GUI-anchored window's `window-start' sits floor(window-screen-lines)+1
lines above `point-max'.  The predicate must judge it \"following output\"
whether or not a mode-line is present.  Measuring the threshold from the
full `window-pixel-height' (mode-line included) only worked because the
mode-line donated the +1 line of slack; disabling it removed that slack
and stranded the cursor off-screen.

In batch the GUI anchor's `forward-line -1' (display-graphic-p only)
cannot run, so `window-start' is set directly; toggling the mode-line in
batch reproduces the GUI geometry shift (the window body grows by one line
while `window-pixel-height' stays constant)."
