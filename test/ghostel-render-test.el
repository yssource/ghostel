;;; ghostel-render-test.el --- Tests for ghostel: rendering -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Renderer-focused tests.  These cover the Emacs-buffer rendering boundary:
;; cell/row rendering, faces, scrollback materialization, clear
;; operations, dirty-row reuse, resize rendering, delayed redraws, and window
;; anchoring.  Feature-specific tests that merely observe the terminal through
;; redraws live with their owning feature (for example shell integration, Evil,
;; line mode, and kitty graphics).

  "Regression: page-serial underflow when initial active area scrolls off entirely.
Scenario (from Hypothesis failure): 1×136 terminal, render once while
empty (seeds pages_in_buffer with the initial blank page serial), then
write 231 lines of 273 bytes each — each line wraps to 3 visual rows,
so 693 total rows cross the libghostty page boundary and force the
active row onto a fresh internal page.  The second redraw must be
incremental (no force-full) so the buffer is not cleared: the renderer
then has existing buffer content to replace rather than append, and
without evicting stale pages_in_buffer entries before rendering it
subtracts old_line_len from the newly-created page whose char_len is
0, causing integer underflow at Renderer.zig:654."
