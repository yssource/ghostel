;;; ghostel-render-test.el --- Tests for ghostel: rendering -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Renderer-focused tests.  These cover the Emacs-buffer rendering boundary:
;; cell/row rendering, faces, hyperlinks, scrollback materialization, clear
;; operations, dirty-row reuse, resize rendering, delayed redraws, and window
;; anchoring.  Feature-specific tests that merely observe the terminal through
;; redraws live with their owning feature (for example shell integration, Evil,
;; line mode, and kitty graphics).

  "Resize keeps the window anchored when Emacs drifted `window-start' below it.
Regression test for issue #127: in TUIs whose cursor sits above the
viewport bottom, opening the minibuffer shrinks the window body and
Emacs's `keep-point-visible' moves `window-start' forward so the TUI
cursor stays on screen.  The resulting `ws < anchor' looked identical
to a real user scroll, so the force redraw captured a blank-row key,
found it at `point-min', and jumped `window-start' to 1.

With the fix, a force redraw classifies a window as anchored when it
wasn't recorded in `ghostel--scroll-positions' at the prior redraw —
so an Emacs-driven drift is treated as drift, not a scroll."

GTK/PGTK input-method candidate windows are anchored to the preedit
overlay at point.  During streaming TUI output, native redraws move
point to the terminal cursor; while preedit text is visible, the
composing window must instead keep the overlay and `window-point' at
the same viewport row and column.
FIXME: `ghostel--term' is bound to a placeholder rather than a real
native handle, and `ghostel--redraw' is stubbed to simulate the
destructive renderer behavior.  A clean rewrite would need a real
terminal fixture with a preedit overlay that survives the renderer's

incremental (no force-full) so the buffer is not cleared: the renderer
then has existing buffer content to replace rather than append, and
without evicting stale pages_in_buffer entries before rendering it
subtracts old_line_len from the newly-created page whose char_len is
